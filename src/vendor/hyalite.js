/*!
 * hyalite v0.5.0 — real refraction "liquid glass" for the web.
 * https://github.com/VII-Cae/hyalite--liquid-glass · MIT © 2026 VII-Cae (VII)
 *
 * How it works
 *   The element is treated as a slab of glass with a bevelled edge. For its exact size and corner
 *   radii we compute a displacement map (R = x offset, G = y offset, B = a signed edge profile),
 *   feed it to an SVG filter, and let the browser bend whatever is *behind* the element through
 *   `backdrop-filter: url(#…)`. The centre stays clear; the edge pulls the world inward, darkens
 *   where it magnifies, and catches a line of light along the rim. Only Chromium runs SVG backdrop
 *   filters; everywhere else the CSS fallback in `var(--hyalite, blur(6px))` takes over — and the
 *   rim, which is CSS, still shows up.
 *
 * Usage
 *   CSS:  .glass {
 *           backdrop-filter: var(--hyalite, blur(6px));
 *           -webkit-backdrop-filter: var(--hyalite, blur(6px));
 *           box-shadow: var(--hyalite-edge, none);      ← the sharp rim, see `edge`
 *         }
 *   JS:   const w = Hyalite.watch(document.body, '.glass', { bevel: 24, thickness: 40 });  w.stop()
 *         Hyalite.attach(el, opts) / Hyalite.detach(el) / Hyalite.refresh(el)
 *         Hyalite.setOpts({ blur: 1 })      // retune everything, returns a Promise (a newer call cancels an older one)
 *         Hyalite.info()                    // geometry, both map URLs, and the sampled edge profile of the last build
 *         Hyalite.supported()               // true only where SVG backdrop filters really render (Chromium)
 *         Hyalite.force(true|false|null)    // override that verdict; null goes back to sniffing
 *
 * Options (all clamped to sane ranges)
 *   bevel        width of the bent zone along the edge, px. Clamped to half the short side — *not*
 *                to the corner radius any more, so a circle can bend all the way to its centre
 *   thickness    glass thickness, px — drives how far the edge pulls the backdrop inward
 *   slope        cap on how fast the displacement decays, px/px. At 1 the sampling point stands
 *                still (infinite stretch); above it the field *folds* — the same backdrop shows up
 *                twice and the rim fills with the liquid swirls Apple's glass has. Folding also
 *                rules out the two-pass anti-staircase (see `smooth`), so it wants blur and
 *                dispersion to cover for it, and a bevel narrow enough to keep the mess contained
 *   shape        'circle' | 'squircle' | 'lip' — the bevel's cross-section. squircle meets the slab
 *                more gently than a quarter circle; lip is raised at the rim and dipped behind it,
 *                which reverses the tilt in the middle and adds a second pair of light/dark bands
 *   blur         frost in the centre, px (feGaussianBlur stdDeviation)
 *   dispersion   chromatic aberration in *pixels* of channel separation — a material constant of the
 *                glass, unrelated to how strong the lens is. `0` is a single pass and cheaper
 *   shade        how much the edge darkens, 0–2. Two things at once, in the ratio they were tuned:
 *                the caustic (the edge magnifies the backdrop, so its energy is spread thin) and
 *                the Fresnel transmission loss. `0` leaves the refraction unshaded
 *   rim          how much light the edge sends back, 0–4. A wide Fresnel sheen plus a tight
 *                specular line, again in a fixed ratio. This is *inside* the filter — for the
 *                pixel-sharp outer line see `edge`
 *   edgeW        px — how far in the shading and the sheen reach. Absolute on purpose: the bright
 *                line and the dark hairline under it are a pixel or two of real glass whatever the
 *                bevel is, and scaling them with the bevel turns a wide rim into a grey band
 *   sat          saturation inside the bevel ring, 0–3. Folding plus dispersion muddies the colour
 *                along the rim; below 1 cleans it up. The centre is never touched. 1 = off (and the
 *                seven filter nodes it costs are skipped)
 *   edge         strength of the CSS rim written to `--hyalite-edge`, 0–2. Inset shadows on the
 *                element itself, so they stay crisp where a filter-drawn line would not — and they
 *                work in browsers that get no refraction at all. `0` writes `none`
 *   light        light direction in degrees: 0 = straight above, positive = clockwise
 *   smooth       px — blur that hides Chromium's nearest-neighbour staircase along the rim (rule 4).
 *                Only the bevel ring sees it, never the centre. Ignored when the field folds
 *                (`slope` > 1), where no two-pass split exists. `0` = one pass, no hiding
 *   materialize  ms — on attach, ramp displacement, shade and rim from 0 (Apple's "materialize")
 *   settle       ms — coalesce resizes: rebuild once, `settle` ms after the last size change. Until
 *                then the browser stretches the current map over the new box (the filter region
 *                follows the element), so the glass never drops out. 0 = live: the first change of a
 *                burst rebuilds before that frame paints, then at most one rebuild per 90 ms while
 *                the size keeps moving, and a last one once it stops. Live is right for anything that
 *                grows in steps (a chat bubble); `settle` is for a box someone is dragging
 *   self         true when the element uses `filter:` on itself instead of `backdrop-filter`
 *                (displacement only: no blur, no dispersion, no shading — see notes)
 *   onBuild(info) called after every *map* build (a filter rebuilt from a cached map does not build one)
 *
 * Rules learned the hard way (each one leaves a visible artifact if broken)
 *   1. Past a decay slope of 1 the displacement folds. Until 0.4.0 that was forbidden; it is now an
 *      option, because folding is where the liquid look comes from. It is still a cliff: the folded
 *      zone has infinite stretch, so keep it inside a narrow bevel and cover it.
 *   2. Direction is taken from a larger rounded rect (radius + bevel), so the turn from "pull down"
 *      to "pull right" is spread along a longer arc — otherwise corners look like a ridge. That
 *      widened radius is capped at *half the short side*: past it makeSDF's rounded-rect formula
 *      stops holding (W/2 − R goes negative) and the gradient flips sign across the axes. A circle
 *      sits exactly at the limit — before 0.3.1 it rendered with a cross-shaped seam.
 *   3. Geometry scales, optics does not. The bevel and the displacement are proportions of the
 *      element; the dispersion, the bright line and the dark band under it are fixed pixel counts.
 *      Mixing the two is what turns a thick lens into a radial rainbow and a wide rim into grey mud.
 *   4. Chromium samples the bent picture nearest-neighbour: Skia's displacement effect is pinned to
 *      kNearest (skbug.com/40045448), so a 6.7× stretch at the rim copies every source pixel into a
 *      6.7px block and any hard edge behind the glass turns into stairs. Where the field does not
 *      fold it is split into two displacement passes of equal stretch that compose *exactly* to the
 *      one-pass field (the inner table is the inverse of the outer one, not a halving), with a
 *      `smooth`-px blur between them masked to the bevel ring. The centre is untouched.
 *   5. The filter chain interpolates in sRGB, so a linear-light ratio has to be re-encoded before it
 *      is multiplied in. Skipping that (^1/2.2) turns a caustic gain of 0.15 into a near-black
 *      outline instead of a shade.
 *   6. Never leave the glass on a resize. Until 0.4.0 the filter region was pinned to the size the
 *      map was built for, so the moment a chat bubble grew a line Chromium painted it unfiltered,
 *      and the "settle" mode papered over that with a plain blur plus a ramp back — which is a
 *      lens → frost → lens flicker at every pause in a streaming reply. The region is now the
 *      element's own box (objectBoundingBox), so between rebuilds the old map is merely stretched,
 *      and the rebuild itself is a single-frame swap: a freshly built filter renders correctly on
 *      its first frame, verified frame by frame.
 *   7. Pin the blurred backdrop opaque before the dispersion sum. The backdrop a reference filter
 *      receives ends at the element's box, so the blur fades the outermost rows to partial alpha,
 *      and summing three premultiplied channel passes there clamps the alpha while tripling the
 *      colour — a white hairline along the rim on the frames where the rim still samples its own
 *      boundary (the start of a materialize ramp). One feColorMatrix that sets alpha to 1 keeps the
 *      blurred colour and drops the fade; not applied in `self` mode, where the source is meant to
 *      be translucent.
 *
 * Caching, in two levels
 *   A *map* depends on geometry + bevel + thickness + slope + shape + shade + rim + edgeW + light;
 *   a *filter* adds blur, dispersion, smooth and self. A map build always produces both PNGs (outer
 *   and inner), so `smooth` can be toggled without a rebuild. So `setOpts({ blur })` rebuilds a
 *   handful of DOM nodes and reuses every map. Map sizes are bucketed (≤ 2 % per side; elements up
 *   to QZ_MIN px stay exact) so a column of chat bubbles a few pixels apart shares one map. The
 *   radii are deliberately *not* rescaled to match — that would put the element's own width back
 *   into the key and defeat the bucket; feImage squeezes the map by up to 2 % instead, which pulls
 *   the outline in by under half a pixel at ordinary radii. Maps whose last user went away stay
 *   warm (MAX_IDLE_MAPS of them), then go oldest-first.
 *
 * Notes
 *   · The materialize ramp runs on a private clone of the shared filter, so animating one element
 *     never touches another.
 *   · `self` mode exists because the 3-pass dispersion sum is only valid for opaque sources.
 *     On a translucent layer alpha is added three times and clamped, which darkens the colour.
 *   · `--hyalite` and `--hyalite-edge` are inherited custom properties: consume them only on the
 *     attached element.
 *   · Maps for large elements are downsampled (MAX_MAP_PX); the field is smooth, feImage stretches
 *     it back without visible loss. With four equal corners only one quadrant is computed and the
 *     other three are mirrored — the lit half of the edge profile is not symmetric, but recovering
 *     it costs one dot product.
 *   · Sizes come from offsetWidth/Height (layout box, transform-proof). Corner radii follow the CSS
 *     overlap rule — one shared shrink factor, not a per-corner clamp — so a 320×40 card with
 *     `border-radius: 24px 24px 0 0` really gets 24px corners. Elliptical radii use their horizontal
 *     value; % radii resolve against the shorter side.
 *   · Nothing is written to `--hyalite` when unsupported, so the CSS fallback wins. Firefox renders
 *     the element unfiltered for SVG backdrop filters; Safari keeps the blur only (a WebKit
 *     implementation is in review). When it ships, `Hyalite.force(true)` or
 *     `<html data-hyalite="force">` turns the engine on without editing this file.
 *   · Respects prefers-reduced-motion (no ramps).
 *   · feImage uses a data: URL — a strict CSP needs `img-src data:`.
